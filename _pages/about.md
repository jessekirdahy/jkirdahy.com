I am an educational technology specialist in a Boston area public school district, where I bring many of my interests in technology and sociology into my lab and classrooms. This site is a space for me to keep a public record of thoughts, code, experiments, and hopefully successes in areas such as:

- 3D design and printing
- Coding for kids
- Game development
- Web design
- Ed tech administration
- Fab lab / maker space management
