Iâ€™m a C# and TSQL developer who works in medical laboratory informatics. I have a particular interest in unit testing, software safety, developer productivity and code generation.

If you want to reach out to me (until I get a contact form setup), create an issue [here](https://github.com/Siphonophora/mjconrad.com).
