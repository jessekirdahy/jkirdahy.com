# Hello World!
This is my first post on this new site created using Jekyll. My thanks to my friend, Mike Conrad, for encouraging me to try out a static site generator. After having taken a break for a few years from serious web publishing, it's very odd to see the trend move from server-hosted CMSes back to locally built sites, like I used to create using Frontpage back in the early 2000s.

I'm hoping to fill this site with some of the more technical work I do in my job, and in my spare time. You can see more about these plans on the site's About page.
