title: "Fusion 360: Designing a Replacement Trigger for a DeWalt Clamp"
published: true
---

A colleague who teaches science came to me with a DeWalt trigger clamp that had lost its trigger, and he asked me if I could print a replacement since trying to order one through official channels could take months or a full school year. Fulfilling this request would be a small coup for me as I was trying to show staff the direct benefits to them of having 3D printing in house.

A quick look on Tinkercad and [Printables](http://printables.com) showed no existing designs, so I got started creating my own in Fusion 360. Since I'm still learning CAD, any opportunity to practice designing different objects is welcome. I took some reference images and started with a sketch, as I'm working on understanding constraints better. The rest of the design was pretty quick, and I was able to print a prototype in PLA on one of our Prusas that afternoon. Testing showed it fit and performed its action well, so I filleted to my heart's content and printed a final version on PETG on my Voron. (The moire pattern on the print was because bolts on a part connecting a Z belt to the gantry were coming loose.)
