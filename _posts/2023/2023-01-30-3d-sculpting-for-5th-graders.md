title: "3D Sculpting for 5th Graders"
---

3D sculpting tools like the free [Sculptfab](https://labs.sketchfab.com/sculptfab/) or [SculptGL](https://stephaneginier.com/sculptgl/) make it quick and easy for students to see desirable results in their designs. Unlike other simple 3D deisgn tools like Tinkercad, which uses parametric geometric primitives, sculpting tools offer intuitive controls that respond to direct clicks or finger taps, showing results immediately. It's for this reason that I tend to start students with Sculptfab when they're beginning to learn 3D design.

## Sculpting Calaveras for Dia de los Muertos
One of my colleagues, a fifth grade teacher, mentioned she was doing a couple of Dia de los Muertos lessons to tie into a novel the class was reading, and I jumped on this immediately since I was trying to build students' interest in 3D printing. I suggested students could design and print calaverasâ€”the colorfully decorated skulls that Central American cultures make out of sugar for Dia de los Muertos. My colleague put together a slideshow for students about the cultural significance of the day and the skulls, and I got busy figuring out how we would do the design and printing.

I've used Sculptfab and SculptGL in the past, and I decided to go with Sculptfab for this lesson since the file management is slightly easier in it, and students who had gotten accustomed to using Chromebooks with all their work automatically saved on Google Drive would need to manually download and then send me their files. (I cannot believe how hard it is to help children understand filesystems and file sharing.) Additionally, Sculptfab's UI is just a little bit cleaner than SculptGL, and the simpler the better when introducing new tech skills like this to students.

With any lesson where I'm trying or creating a new product for the first time, I find it's essential to go through the entire process myself. Packaged curriculum that has already been tested often needs this, and bespoke lessons even more so. By "debugging" a lesson, you inevitably discover things in practice that you can't always anticipate when just thinking through a lesson:
-  The skull model required modification to flatten a surface in order to be printable, and students would not be able to sculpt over this flattened surface
-  The original poly count of the model made it difficult to work with, necessitating reducing it before distributing to students
-  The skull model broke in certain areas while sculpting, and Sculptfab's tools couldn't easily fix that once it happened
-  Certain keyboard shortcuts produce unexpected behavior in Sculptfab (looking at you Command + Z)
-  The camera would be tricky for inexperienced students, and the camera reset menu item looked similar to the project reset menu item



## Next Steps for Students After Sculpting?
I've found fourth grade to be about the right age to introduce students to more demanding and more capable design tools like Tinkercad if they have already had some experience with 3D sculpting.
